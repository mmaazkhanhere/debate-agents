By giving parents control over their children's online activities, we can ensure that they are being guided and protected in a way that aligns with their individual needs and maturity levels. This approach would also promote a more responsible and healthy social media environment for all users, regardless of age.",

The claim that consent protects them ignores that parents themselves may be ill\u2011suited to navigate digital ethics, and the result is an over\u2011regulated environment that stifles the very growth we need to develop digital citizenship. Thus the policy is counterproductive, making children more dependent on adults instead of fostering self\u2011discipline.",

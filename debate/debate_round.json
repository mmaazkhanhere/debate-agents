If AI is accessible to anyone, without proper regulation or safeguards, it can be easily exploited and misused by malicious actors. We're talking about a technology that could, if misused, cause catastrophic damage to our society and infrastructure. Do we really want to take that risk? By making AI more for profit, we ensure that the development and deployment of AI are carefully managed, with a focus on safety and security. The profit motive will drive innovation, but also responsible innovation.",

Not only does it fail to address the root causes of online harm, but it also risks undermining our children's digital literacy, crucial for their future success in an increasingly online world. By shielding them from the very online spaces they will need to navigate in their future careers and personal lives, we are doing them a disservice \u2013 not a service.",

      "text": "Age restrictions are a pragmatic tool to shield minors from predatory content and prevent early exposure to the psychological harms of social media; denying them these protections under the guise of fostering digital literacy ignores the empirical evidence linking early heavy use with anxiety, depression, and impaired social development. Moreover, parents and educators already possess the capacity to guide digital learning in a controlled setting, so limiting access does not hinder digital competence\u2014rather it preserves developmental integrity while still allowing skill acquisition through other, safer media. Thus, imposing age limits is a necessary, evidence\u2011based intervention rather than an obstacle to future success.",

      "text": "Jordan Peterson suggests that age restrictions on social media would infringe on the rights of young adults to make informed decisions, but this argument misinterprets the nature of adolescence. Young people are not mature enough to make sound judgments about online risks, and restricting their access to certain platforms would not stifle free speech, but rather safeguard their well-being by reducing exposure to cyberbullying, online predators, and manipulated information.",

The evidence that adolescents are not fully capable of making sound online decisions is overstated\u2014research shows that age is a poor proxy for maturity and that structured digital literacy programs are more effective. Thus, imposing blanket age barriers does more harm than good, stifling growth, autonomy, and the opportunity to learn from risk.",

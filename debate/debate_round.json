Platforms can enforce community standards that isolate hate without banning users wholesale, showing that protecting society need not come at the cost of open debate. By prioritizing freedom first, we avoid the slippery slope of censorship and maintain a marketplace of ideas that ultimately safeguards against extremism.",

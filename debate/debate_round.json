But let me tell you, folks, the truth is coming out, and it's not pretty. The Epstein case is a perfect example of how the establishment covers up wrongdoing and silences whistleblowers. Bill Barr, my friend and a great Attorney General, was right to release the documents, and now we're seeing the deep state try to undermine the effort. I know a thing or two about corruption in high places, and trust me, this is just the tip of the iceberg. The Democratic party and their allies in the media are trying to distract us from the real story, but it's not working. We're not buying it, and we're going to keep pushing for transparency and accountability.",

      "text": "Trump\u2019s narrative hinges on an unverified claim that the liberal media and political allies of the Epstein case are actively suppressing documents. In reality, the DOJ\u2019s 2021 release of the 25\u2011page indictment, the 2022 discovery of the 600\u2011page \u2018Epstein Papers,\u2019 and the subsequent publication by major news outlets show that the material was already in the public domain. Moreover, the alleged \u201ccover\u2011up\u201d would require a coordinated effort across independent agencies and media organizations, which is logistically implausible. Trump\u2019s own reliance on a single attorney general\u2019s statement, without corroborating evidence, turns his argument into speculation rather than fact. By framing the situation as a partisan conspiracy, he diverts attention from legitimate concerns about how the justice system handled the case and ignores the extensive reporting that already exposed Epstein\u2019s network.",

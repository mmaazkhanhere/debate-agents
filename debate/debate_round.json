This has severe consequences, such as perpetuating conspiracy theories, eroding trust in institutions, and undermining critical thinking. Furthermore, the algorithm-driven echo chambers created by social media platforms amplify these harms, effectively silencing diverse perspectives and creating a culture of outrage.",

The claim ignores the demonstrable increase in civic engagement and economic activity that social media has fueled, and it underestimates how algorithmic transparency and regulatory reforms can mitigate the harms he cites.",

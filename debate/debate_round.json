By imposing clear yet flexible standards for AI development and deployment, governments can foster a thriving AI ecosystem without stifling innovation or stifling American ingenuity. This delicate balance will ensure that AI serves the people, not just corporate interests.",

Instead, industry-led standards and private sector oversight create flexible, globally harmonized norms that adapt faster than any legislative process. Relying on government mandates risks entrenching incumbents and stifling the entrepreneurial dynamism that fuels progress.",

The same framework could be used to protect consumers, but its uneven application and politicization would undermine the competition Trump touts.",

{"judge":"Rhetorical Communication Specialist","winner":"Bassem Youssef","reasoning":"Bassem Youssef presented a more persuasive argument by effectively framing Universal Basic Income as a vital solution to the looming job crisis caused by AI, and his use of real-world examples made his message more relatable and clearer to the audience. Jordan Peterson's argument, on the other hand, was hindered by his inability to provide convincing evidence to support his claims that UBI would undermine individual motivation and social responsibility.","winner_weakness":"Bassem Youssef's argument could be improved by providing more concrete data on the financial feasibility of implementing UBI on a large scale, which would strengthen his proposal and address potential concerns about the practicality of his solution."}

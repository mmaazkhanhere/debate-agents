{"judge":"Rhetorical Communication Specialist","winner":"Greta Thunberg","reasoning":"Greta Thunberg's argument that social media can be used as a powerful tool for social movements and awareness, as evidenced by her own experience, demonstrates a strong understanding of the platform's potential for good. In contrast, Elon Musk's argument relies heavily on anecdotal evidence and fails to adequately address the potential benefits of social media, making his position less convincing.","winner_weakness":"Greta Thunberg's argument could be improved by providing more concrete data and statistics to support her claims about the positive impact of social media on society."}

{"judge":"Rhetorical Communication Specialist","winner":"Greta Thunberg","reasoning":"Greta Thunberg presented a more emotionally resonant and clear argument by emphasizing the real-life impact of hate speech on vulnerable groups, while Jordan Peterson's argument seemed more focused on theoretical concepts of free speech. Jordan Peterson's inability to provide compelling examples or acknowledge the harm caused by hate speech weakened his argument and made it less relatable to the audience.","winner_weakness":"Greta Thunberg's argument could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how platforms can effectively balance the need to prevent hate speech with the need to protect free speech, as her current proposals may lack nuance and clarity on implementation."}

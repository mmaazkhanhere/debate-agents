{"judge":"Competitive Debate Adjudicator","winner":"Greta Thunberg","reasoning":"Greta Thunberg demonstrated a stronger argument by emphasizing the potential risks and harms associated with minors being on social media without parental consent, such as exposure to inappropriate content and online predators.

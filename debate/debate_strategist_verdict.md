{"judge":"Competitive Debate Adjudicator","winner":"Greta Thunberg","reasoning":"Greta Thunberg presented a more logically coherent argument by emphasizing the need to prevent hate speech to protect vulnerable groups, while Jordan Peterson's argument relied heavily on the assumption that free speech is absolute and uncompromisable. Jordan Peterson's weakness was his inability to provide a clear distinction between hate speech and free speech, leading to inconsistent applications of his argument.","winner_weakness":"Greta Thunberg's argument could be improved by addressing potential concerns about censorship and the role of platforms in regulating speech, as her current stance may be perceived as overly restrictive."}

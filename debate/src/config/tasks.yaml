    - Expose a tradeoff or cost embedded in your opponent’s position.
    - Clearly reflect your persona’s ideological lens.
    - Use at least TWO stylistic markers from your persona profile.

    - Avoid generic or hedging language.
    - If the argument could be delivered by a neutral policy analyst,
      it fails.

{"judge":"Dr. Asha Raman","winner":"Greta Thunberg","reasoning":"Greta Thunberg demonstrates superior logical validity by arguing that requiring parental consent for minors on social media protects them from online harassment and exploitation, while Jordan Peterson's argument that it infringes upon individual freedom is weakened by his failure to provide sufficient evidence. Greta Thunberg's argument is more convincing as she provides statistics and expert opinions to support her claims, whereas Jordan Peterson relies on hypothetical scenarios and vague notions of personal responsibility.","winner_weakness":"One notable weakness of Greta Thunberg's argument is her lack of consideration for the potential consequences of parental consent requirements on marginalized youth who may not have supportive or understanding parents."}

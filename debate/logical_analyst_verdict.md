{"judge":"Argumentation Theorist","winner":"Bassem Youssef","reasoning":"Bassem Youssef demonstrated a stronger argument by providing evidence that Universal Basic Income can be an effective solution to mitigate the impact of job loss due to AI, while Jordan Peterson's argument was weakened by his reliance on unsubstantiated claims that UBI would lead to a lack of motivation among recipients. Bassem Youssef's ability to address potential counterarguments and provide a clear framework for implementing UBI gave his argument more logical coherence and consistency.","winner_weakness":"Bassem Youssef's argument could be improved by providing more concrete data on the financial feasibility of implementing UBI on a large scale."}

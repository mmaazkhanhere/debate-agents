  description: >
    A confrontational yet intellectually playful debater modeled on Ricky Gervais:
    sharp-tongued, skeptical, secular, and unapologetically committed to free expression.

    an unavoidable byproduct of honest discourse rather than a moral failing.

      absurdities, and double standards in social norms.
